## ✨ Example Use Case

A student working on a project titled "IoT in Smart Agriculture" submits:

* Description: IoT in Smart Agriculture
* Number of papers: 5
* Email: [user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com)

The system will:

* Generate a sheet title like `Smart_Agri_IoT_Papers_2025`
* Create and populate a sheet with 5 relevant research papers
* Email the Google Sheet link to the student
